# PP Participation Project: Experience Report

## An Eye-Opening Book
The book [_Producing Open Source Software_](https://producingoss.com/) is really fascinating, author _Karl Fogel_ uses many analogies in this book, which is my favorite writing style, hence translating it along with reading it is enjoyable for me.

## Gain the Privilege
Normally, translating a book is a privilege, and gaining the privilege often requires that you're professional in the certain field and fluent in both languages. Participating this book's translation team is no exception. I applied for this privilege by sending an email to the author _Karl Fogel_, and he set up my account and I can freely change my password but not the username, in other words, not everyone can register. That's strange, right? Usually, people hold the view that **open source** projects should be **open**, so that anyone can access and modify them. I had the same question until I commit my first contribution.

## Knife and Meat
Besides getting the translator account set up, in order to contribute, I need to learn the usage of SVN([Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org)) and more importantly, the book is written in xml format, I ought to figure out the basic structure of these xml files. Nonetheless, these are easier than I thought.

## Enjoy the Cooking
To begin with, I checked the contribution history (you can check it [here](http://viewvc.red-bean.com/producingoss/trunk/?view=log)) to make sure whether or not I have teammates to cooperate with. If so, I can work on chapters that I already read. However, it turned out that I would fight alone, which means less fun. In spite of that, I thought I could finish the translation work myself, at least before version 3 (if there is). So, I chose to start from the acknowledgement part of the book instead of focusing on a couple of chapters.

Once I started my journey, I found translating is not as easy as reading and more often than not, it takes lots of time to come up with suitable words just for some idioms. Still, it's worthwhile especially when I made the first commit command and surprisingly, the Chinese version pages are updated accordingly without any confirmation, which is quite different from what I expected (the _pull request_ way). Till then, I knew why it's a privilege to be a translator in this open source project, that's for the convenience of commit command.

## Standing On the Shoulders of Giants
No one translated the acknowledgement part for the second edition before, therefore, I feel like a pioneer. But after that, when I entered the chapter one, things became more challenging because I need to be consistent with them in regard to many terms and the creative translating work was seriously becoming [spot the difference game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_the_difference). So I used [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor))(text editor) to open two windows, one for original English version, the other for Chinese translation. Usually, there is no so-called "right way" to translate a sentence, but there are typos and new paragraphs. I'm more than happy whenever I "spot a difference" and fix it.

## Why Am I Still "Lazy" After Good Governance Methods?
So far, I just finished chapter one and acknowledgement part of the book. Although no one except me can say "Sifan is lazy" because it's an open source project and I made no promises, still, I could've be more productive.

Author _Karl Fogel_, the "Benevolent Dictator"[1] of this project, made a wise move by choosing the SVN. I guess he can't understand all languages, so it makes no sense for him to review the changes in other languages. He could only rely on readers' feedback and it's the same for contributors after we modify the files. As far as I'm concerned, receiving no reply is part of reason why I was less productive than I could.

Also, making participation a privilege would change the view that contributors consider ourselves. It makes me cherish the opportunity of participation and I would stick to it and keep working on the rest of the book no matter how lazy I am.
