#Peer Production Participation Project: Experience Report
	Akanksh K Narayana

I have chosen the wikiproject Human-Computer Interaction as part of the participation assignment. It was a good experience to get to know the various ways in which one can add and edit the contents in a Wikipedia page. I added content in the background section of the Human-Computer Interaction wikiproject page. The content was not reviewed and appeared on the wikiproject page as soon as I published the changes. However, there was a warning message at the top of the edit page which said: “Content that violates any copyrights will be deleted. Encyclopaedic content should be verifiable” [1].

There is a talk page assigned to each user where they can add content related to Human-Computer Interaction or just introduce themselves. There is a discussion page, where all the open and closed tasks related to this wikiproject is present. A category page is also present which has all the articles categorized into the various category they belong to. The user is also provided instructions about how to link an article to a category or create a new category for the article. The user can add the content to the above pages and publish it immediately without the approval of any user. Occasionally, there are users who comment on the article if they like it or if any changes are to be implemented.

There is a To-do page, which has all the open tasks for the Human-Computer Interaction project. Each task is described in detail, with a link to it. Additionally, the work that needs to be done on the task (editing, adding reference, adding content etc.) is mentioned next to the task. I took up an open task of editing an article. The edit was published immediately without any review when I clicked on Publish button. I did not find any specific page related to motivation. I think that the users just contribute articles to this wikiproject, to improve the page as a whole, and to make it easier for other users, who do not have prior knowledge about Human-Computer Interaction, to understand the basics of Human-Computer Interaction and the various fields related to it. I think it would be helpful to have a moderator to look after the categorization of the topics, since I found few articles that are not closely related to Human- Computer Interaction.

Few suggestions to improve this page would be to have a forum where the users can interact with each other. This would be helpful for users to take parts of a larger task and collaborate their contributions. Few of the message in the page are unclear, like how to add an article, add a category and so on, and I had a hard time figuring it out initially. It would be better if the wikiproject had an introductory page to the new user which could contain basic information about adding an article, editing an article, finding an open task and restrictions while using this page.
